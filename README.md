# Model-Comparison-for-Heart-Disease-prediction
Machine Learning Project.
Evaluated and compared machine learning models: Decision trees (Bagging, Boosting, Random forest), Neural networks, and Logistic regression on 3 different datasets to find the best fit.  
Evaluation metrics included Accuracy, Misclassification error, Cross validation, ROC Curves.
The folders Cleveland, Spect and Statlog are three different datasets which were from UCL Machine learning repository and these are included in Cleveland, Spect and Statlog folder respectively along with the R code for different machine learning techiniques which we applied for our experiments.
